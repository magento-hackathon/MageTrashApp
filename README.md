MageTrashApp
============

Clean uninstallation or deactivation of Magento modules

## Functionality  ##

Provides the capability to fully disable and uninstall Magento extensions

Uninstall features:

1. Will run a sql uninstall script for module (must be called uninstall.php and be in sql directory)
2. Will attempt to uninstall using PEAR packaging commands (as in Magento Connect)
3. If not package found then will use uninstall file specified in module config.xml (by default, it is etc/uninstall.txt)

Install script features:

1. Delete core_resource to force Magento to run install/upgrade scripts.
2. Rewind core_resource to force Magento to run some install/upgrade scripts.


## Instructions ##

1. Install module (modman file provided)
2. Refresh cache and re-sign into Magento Admin
3. Under System->Configuration->Advanced you will see MageTrashApp
4. For each module you have options to enable, disable, Uninstall
5. For each module you have options to delete or rewind core_resource



## For Developers of modules ##
Place a file uninstall.txt into the folder etc/ of your module to allow to be triggered by this module when you deinstall it.
If you wish to change the name of this uninstall.txt file to something different, just set into the config.xml file of your module, the following:
<config>
	...
	<uninstall>
		<filename>myuninstallfile.txt</filename>
	</uninstall>
</config>

The format of the content should start from the Magento Root path. For example: you want to deinstall the module Namepspace_Mymodule placed into the community code pool
Just do:
app/code/community/Namespace/Mymodule
app/etc/modules/Namespace_Mymodule.xml
js/mynamespace/
skin/frontend/base/default/images/mynapespace

If you have modman, you could copy the file of modman into the etc folder. In this case, the second part of each line will be taken to uninstall your module. 
For example:
src/app/code/community/Namespace/Mymodule 	app/code/community/Namespace/Mymodule
src/app/etc/modules/Namespace_Mymodule.xml 	app/etc/modules/Namespace_Mymodule.xml
